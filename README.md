Hi There! This is a SpringBoot ToDo list app that I used as study project to learn about 
Java Spring Boot 3, the todo list can save and edit data that comes from the H2 database.

I used this project too for learning more about Docker. I turned it into a docker image/Container and deployed it online 
using Render.com as a docker web service.

It was a little struggle to make it work at first,because I got my target folder auto ignored inside the gitingnore file.
However after discover this little secret, it worked perfectly.
